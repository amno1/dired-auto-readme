* Dired Auto Readme

[[./images/txt-mode.png]]

Display a /Readme/ file in a Dired buffer if one exists. The content of the file
is displayed below the directory content. Cursor can freely move into the /Readme/
file content, and you can search, copy, click on links and call some Emacs
functions on the content as avialable in respective modes. However, the file is
read only so you can not modify it, and some other functionality normally found
might also not be available.

I suggest installing [[https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/][markdown-mode]], [[https://github.com/Fuco1/org-pretty-table][org-pretty-table]] and [[https://github.com/amno1/org-view-mode][org-view-mode]] for
prettier renderings. This is just optional. To enable them, add those as options
via user hook (see `dired-auto-readme-alist').

* Install

This is not yet in either Elpa nor Melpa, so currently you will have to either
clone this repository or just download raw dired-auto-readme.el somewhere where
your Emacs can find it.

* Usage

To enable/disable dired-auto-readme-mode: M-x dired-auto-readme-mode.

There are few settings that can be modified, either via
customize->Files->Dired Auto Readme or by setting the variables in init file or
a running Emacs session.

dired-auto-readme-files - A regular expression to specify what is considered as
readme files.

dired-auto-readme-alist - A list holding hooks to be called when a major mode is
enabled in a readme file. It will be called *after* the mode and font-lock are
enabled. For example I have this in my init file to enable some org/markdown
features and to actually enble "view" version of those modes for cleaner preview:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'dired-auto-readme-alist '(org-mode . org-view-mode))
(add-to-list 'dired-auto-readme-alist '(markdown-mode . (lambda ()
                                                          (markdown-view-mode)
                                                          (font-lock-ensure))))
#+end_src

You might have to test a bit if you encounter issues. This mode *alters* the
content of the dired buffer itself, so be sure to enable it as the very **last**
of modes in your buffer.

* Known Problems

We are combining here two major modes from two different buffers in one buffer,
something Emacs is not ment to do so there will be some problems. The real
problem is that most minor modes expect to work with only one major mode buffer,
in this case Dired. If a minor mode will do something over entire Dired buffer
there will be issues, unfortunately. Sometimes it is enough to press 'g' to
update dired buffer so it will render properly, but for some modes there will be
artifacts, and other won't work at all.

For example dired-auto-readme-mode does not play well with overlays. If you are
using some mode that displays overlays, as for example [[https://github.com/clemera/dired-git-info][dired-git-info]], you will
have to refresh your dired buffer after you toggle on/off dired-auto-readme-mode
(just press 'g').

There are hundreds of packages and possible variations, there are probably other
bugs I am not aware off.  See if it works for you, and if/when you find problems,
please report them or even better, give me a PR or send a patch.

What I do here is a dirty (and somewhat inneficient) trick. I simply open file
in another buffer, let Emacs do the magic, and then copy buffer content
inclusive properties over to dired buffer with font-lock (syntax hightlight)
tuned to work only on dired portion of the buffer.

It is inneficient, but As I have tested, I don't notice any speed problems on my
computer, even on one older dual core laptop from 2016. I guess it would need a
directory with hundred files or really big readme file for this to be
noticable (if org/markdown modes are already loaded in Emacs).

To speed up things when browsing directories, I suggest loading org-mode,
rst-mode and markdown-mode in an idle-timer when Emacs starts.

* About

This was inspired by very nice [[https://gitlab.com/kisaragi-hiu/dired-show-readme][dired-show-readme]] by Kisaragi Hiu. However,
dired-show-readme displays a Readme file as an image, and also uses external
process to render a file to an image. It would be possible to use svg-renderer
in Emacs to render to an svg image, however, a drawback of an image is, well,
that it is an image. I find myself often wishing to click on a link in a Readme
file, so I prefer having them as plain text so I can move cursor freely in and
out and copy text, click on links etc.

* News

<2022-09-21 ons>

The package is now (almost) completely reworked again. I think it is getting to
the point where I think it could be submitted as a package to Melpa. Fixed are
some bugs and the implementation is reworked to be more efficient. Also, dealing
with extra beautifying options, like displaying inlined images, markdown/org
view modes, are now left for the end user as an option in respective mode
hooks. That lets me remove few options, and simplify the package while making it
more efficient too.

Gone is also private "mime" list, auto-readme-mode now automatically enables
whichever mode is registered with Emacs with a given extension. There is still
`dired-auto-readme-alist' which holds cons pairs in form of (major-mode . hook).
Hook is an user function called when a major-mode is enabled in README buffer.

<2022-02-10 tor>

Refactored more, made it to work with org-view-mode for even prettier dired
renderings.

<2021-05-10 mån>

Completely reworked, with better org/markdown preview.
